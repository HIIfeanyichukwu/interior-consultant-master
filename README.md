## Overview

![screenshot](./web.png)

Developing mobile navigations with html and css was quite difficult for me damn.
I was torn between using buttons for the menu and close icons, and using pseudo class ::before and ::after.

I ended with using buttons over psuedo classes.

There are not enough resources explaining the implementation of mobile menus, whether to use buttons or not.

I hope my solution helps you, But if you find a better solution please share with me. thankyou.
